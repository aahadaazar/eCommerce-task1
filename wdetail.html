<p id="summary"><strong>Classic Game Room reviews the NINTENDO Wii video game console! The Wii could be Nintendo's best console since the original NES Nintendo Entertainment System.  The Wii is a revolutionary gaming system and this Wii review shows what makes the Wii special vs. the PS4 and the Xbox One.  Is the Wii for you, would you rather play Wii fit or shoot things with massive laser cannons in HDTV graphics?  The Wii may not be hi-def but it is hi-tech and has a really unique controller that uses motion sensing technology and a nunchuk to make actions happen on the screen. The Wii is marketed as a unique social gaming console with a more family appropriate array of games.  It gets you up off the couch and can have you dacing around the room playing games like Wii Sports Bowling, Golf and Far Cry Vengeance.<br>
